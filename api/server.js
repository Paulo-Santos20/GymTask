/* A push subscription's `endpoint` is a URL this server connects out to, chosen by whoever is
   signed in — so without a check /api/push/* is a request-forgery lever, and the api container
   sits on the same Docker network as the rest of the self-hoster's stack. Three limits below:

   1. PUSH_AGENT rejects any connection to a private/loopback/link-local address at the moment
      the socket is opened. Validating the URL alone would leave a DNS-rebinding window — the
      name is resolved a second time inside web-push — so the check has to live in the lookup
      the request itself uses, not in a prior pass. A literal IP address never goes through
      that lookup at all — Node hands it straight to connect() — so literals are judged by
      pushEndpointError instead: at subscribe, and again in sendPush for an endpoint that got
      into db.json some other way.
   2. PUSH_TIMEOUT_MS: an endpoint that accepts TCP and then stalls used to hang the request
      handler that awaited it, indefinitely. web-push sets no timeout of its own.
   3. PUSH_CONCURRENCY: one small request must not turn into an unbounded burst of outbound
      connections (with MAX_SUBS_PER_USER below, that is the other half of the same problem). */
